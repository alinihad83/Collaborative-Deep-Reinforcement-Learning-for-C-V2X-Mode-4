# Collaborative-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-C-V2X-Mode-4
This framework is for resource allocation in C-V2X Mode 4

To use this first intall the python version 3.9 on linux or use anaonda virtual environment.

This framework demonstrates the distributed resource allocation approach utilizing deep reinforcement learning for C-V2X mode 4. 
- Inline with the 3gpp Rel 16, specifications, we utilize the semi-persistent schedulling (SPS) defined for C-V2X mode 4.
- This is soley built for research purpose. However, to include full features and integration with the LTE module of ns-3 is in progress.
